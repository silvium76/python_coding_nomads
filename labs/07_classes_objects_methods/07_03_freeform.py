'''
- Write a script with three classes that model everyday objects.
- Each class should have an __init__ method that sets at least three attributes
- Create at least two objects of each class using the __init__ method.
- Include a __str__ method in each class that prints out the attributes
    in a nicely formatted string.
- Overload the __add__ method in one of the classes so that it's possible
    to add attributes of two instances of that class using the + operator.
- Once the objects are created, change some of the attribute values.

Be creative. Have some fun. :)
Using objects you can model anything you want.
Cars, animals, poker games, sports teams, trees, beers, people etc...
